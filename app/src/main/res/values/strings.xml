    <string name="less_than_25">Life causes you immense pain. You feel confused most of the time. You have few friends and the people
        you do associate with, likely share the same views of the world as you. Your focus is primarily on what you cannot control or
        influence and thus you are left feeling constantly overwhelmed and out of control. You view life as a disappointment so far
        and you allow the forces outside of yourself to dominate you. This is what we refer to as Level 3 living.</string>
    <string name="less_than_50">You often find life confusing. You feel out of control and ask yourself ‘why me? “The world is scary
        to you and you most likely blame others for your poor results. You tend to not take risks and stay in your comfort zone.
        Change is difficult for you, you would like to live your life on a level 2 and have more control, but you tend to be in the
        level 3 zone and that frustrates you.</string>
    <string name="less_than_75">You have mixed results in your life and wonder if it is luck. You sometimes wonder what you are doing
        wrong and how you can turn things around. You can be disappointed by people and events in the world. You are willing to take
        some risks to change as long as you can see the benefits. You operate at level 2 but when things get confusing or frustrating
        you digress to level 3.</string>
    <string name="less_than_100">You have the belief that your reality is up to you. You hold yourself accountable for your world.
        You are willing to learn new ways of doing things and regard challenges as learning opportunities. You enjoy life and what it presents.
        You take yourself lightly, you live at level 1 most of the time and you are aware of when you are choosing not to.</string>
